# IP-IPRH
This is the Matlab source code of paper "Learning In-Place Residual Homogeneity for Single Image Detail Enhancement"

If you have any questions, send me the E-mail (jianghe2012@sjtu.edu.cn, jiangherenren@163.com)

Run ICASSP_demo.m/ demo_faster.m to start the slower/faster version 

We add another version of the Matlab code in the folder "IPRH_twice", click main_demo.m to run the program directly, you can increase or decrease the detail magnification factor (set as 2 globally) to get the appropriate detail enhancement image as you like
